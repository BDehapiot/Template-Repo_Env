#### 2 - Install miniconda: 
- Download the last installer and run the .exe file
- Use default options (it can be modified later anyway)

#### 3 - Setup conda environment: 
- Navigate to your Anaconda3 folder through the start menu and run `Anaconda Powershell Prompt`  
- Your prompt should look like this:
 ```bash
(base) PS C:\Users\YourUsername>
```
- `(base)` at the beginning of the prompt means that you are in your base conda environment
- Now you can check your conda (miniconda) installation by typing the following command:
 ```bash
conda --version
```
- You should be able to retreive the conda version, otherwise if conda is not recognized please proceed again to step 2.
